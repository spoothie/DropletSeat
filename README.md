DropletSeat
==============
Seating and chairs "Droplet" plugin for the Spout platform to demonstrate the usage of player events and metadata.

## What is Spout?
Spout is an open source multi-threaded Java voxel-based game framework and platform that opens the doors for infinite possibilities and expansion at the fingertips of gamers and developers alike. Through the use of the Spout platform's API, developers can create "game" plugins, which use our client and server platform as a base. Players will be able to swap between games on-the-fly as they switch to a server running a different game plugin, or a set of game plugins.
